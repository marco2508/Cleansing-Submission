Coursera - Cleansing - Wk4

This is the readme file for the final assignment of the Getting and Cleansing Course on Coursera

This repository contains:
- run_analysis.R        the R logic that processes the files and transforms it into the desired output logic
The R file does not contain logic to download the files. Was unsure if this was part of the assignment.
- tidy_data_summary.txt the result of the logic from the previous R file
- codebook.md           describes what is done in the R file and what is inside the data.

The actual data files are not included; they can be found over here:
